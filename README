There isn't much to look at.

It's currently using thoughtbot-clearance. 

It has a post model.

It has a pretty basic layout and a theme.css file.

So, basically, you don't install themes, you just write your own theme.css. If the application layout isn't flexible enough, you can alter that.

Also, there is a sidebar partial. You can put stuff in there.

So it isn't much, still, but face it, you were going to write your own theme anyways, right?

TODO: Add comments? Or maybe allow Disqus to plugin? Maybe.

That is all.

(It is a blog.)
